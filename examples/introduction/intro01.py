# Purpose: Demonstrates how to build an instance of the HSPFModel class 
# that can be used to run HSPF simulations. Minimal assumptions are made 
# of the user's background in Python. The idea is to learn how the 
# "think in HSPF."
#
# Last updated: 09/20/2014
#
# This is a very basic example of how to create an HSPF model in Python using 
# PyHSPF. No external data files are needed. Python can be used to script the
# data in as needed. Details throughout. Keep in mind this is a "walk before
# you run" approach.

# import the Python datetime module to work with simulation period

import datetime

# start and end dates (year 2001)

start = datetime.datetime(2001, 1, 1)
end   = datetime.datetime(2002, 1, 1)

# do a 4-hour timestep; time step should be specified in minutes. HSPF can use
# any time step from 1 minute to 1 day (1440 minutes) as long as it divides 
# evenly into 1440.

tstep = 240

# PyHSPF has a "Watershed" class as a container for information about the 
# physical hydrography of the watershed. instances of this class are used to
# generate the HSPFModel class. the following lines illustrate how to use it.

from pyhspf import Watershed

# first the watershed needs to be subdivided into subbasins, which are
# stored in a dictionary where the keys correspond to the names you want 
# to give them. the keys must be strings of at most 15 characters for 
# consistency with the WDM format. a subbasin consists of a flowplane to 
# store information about the landscape, the reach/reservoir that the land 
# drains to, and landuse (or other category data) to sudivide the subbasin 
# into homogeneous land segments. 

from pyhspf import Subbasin

# keep up with the subbasins using the "subbasin" dictionary

subbasins = {} 

# call the first subbasin "100"

number   = '100'

# create subbasin "100"

subbasin = Subbasin(number)

# subbasins are defined by many attributes, which are grouped into categories 
# in PyHSPF Subbasin class instances including:
#
# --the flowplane (length, slope, centroid, average elevation)
#
# --the reach (name, upstream elevation, downstream elevation, length, 
#              optionally average flow rate and velocity)
#
# --the landuse categories to be used by the model and the corresponding areas 
# within each subbasin 
#
# --the inlets and outlets from the watershed

# flow plane parameters for the subbasin

length     = 100       # m
planeslope = 0.02      # -
elev       = 100       # m
centroid   = [-90, 40] # lon, lat

# add the flow plane data for subbasin 100

subbasin.add_flowplane(length, planeslope, centroid, elev)

# now let's provide the info about the reach

name       = 'dave stream' # something descriptive
maxelev    = 110           # elevation at the top of the reach (m)
minelev    = 100           # elevation at the bottom of the reach (m)
slopelen   = 10            # the reach length (km)

# HSPF uses "FTABLES" to specify the stage-discharge relationship for a reach.
# PyHSPF can estimate the FTABLE using the average flow and velocity, or the
# FTABLE can be specified directly. here the FTABLE for this subbasin reach 
# is generated from average flow and velocity.

flow       = 10            # the inflow (cfs) must use these units
velocity   = 1             # velocity (fps) again must use these units

# add the reach to the subbasin

subbasin.add_reach(name, maxelev, minelev, slopelen, flow = flow, 
                   velocity = velocity)

# here is an alternative set of statements to supply the FTABLE directly.
# An FTABLE consists of 4 columns representing the relationships between
# depth, surface area, volume, and flow for a reach. HSPF does a linear 
# interpolation between the depths in the first column to estimate the 
# other parameters. Up to 18 rows can be used.

#ftable = [[0,0,0,0],
#          [1,1,100,1],
#          ]

#subbasin.add_reach(name, maxelev, minelev, slopelen, ftable = ftable)

# another piece of info needed for the subbasins is the land use (used to 
# subdivide the subbasins into land segments, e.g. soils). so here this subbasin
# is assumed to be 20% developed (with 50% impervious/50% pervious land), 
# 40% agriculture, and 40% forest. The areas are in square km so we get 20 km2 
# impervious, etc. 
#
# variable land use can be provided (e.g., for different years), but it's 
# not necessary to change it for HSPF. impervious land must be specified as
# "Developed" to identify it; the relative percentages of developed land can 
# be changed from the default of 50% if desired using the "ifraction" keyword.

landuse_names = ['Developed', 'Agriculture', 'Forest']
areas         = [20, 40, 40]

subbasin.add_landuse(2001, landuse_names, areas)

# now it's done; let's add the subbasin to the dictionary of subbasins

subbasins[number] = subbasin

# make one more subbasin for this example (note all the parameters are the
# same except these few)

number   = '101'
subbasin = Subbasin(number)

# let's just use the same flowplane parameters

subbasin.add_flowplane(length, planeslope, centroid, elev)

# slightly change the reach info

maxelev    = 100 
minelev    = 90
flow       = 12

subbasin.add_reach(name, maxelev, minelev, slopelen, flow = flow, 
                   velocity = velocity)

# for simplicity just assume the same landuse types and areas

subbasin.add_landuse(2001, landuse_names, areas)

# and add the subbasin to the subbasins dictionary

subbasins[number] = subbasin

# now that that subbasins are specified it is possible to create an instance 
# of the Watershed class that is used to build the HSPF input files.

watershed_name = 'Dave'

watershed = Watershed(watershed_name, subbasins)

# another key piece of information for the watershed is the flow network. 
# it should be provided as  an "updown" dictionary--that is, subbasin names
# are supplied as keys, and the dictionary returns the downstream subbasin 
# names as values. So for this example the netword is just subbasin reach "100"
# goes into "101." 

updown = {'100':'101'}

# add the mass linkage dictionary to the watershed

watershed.add_mass_linkage(updown)

# need to tell HSPF that subbasin "101" is an outlet where mass leaves. this
# information is needed because PyHSPF starts at the outlet and works 
# upstream to build the HSPF model.

watershed.add_outlet('101')

# that is all the physical hydrography data needed by HSPF. the HSPFmodel class
# can be used to build the HSPF files for the simulation (the input and output 
# WDM files and the UCI file).

from pyhspf import HSPFModel

# names of the files used in the simulation (the HSPF input and output files
# are generated automatically); can also specify a directory to use elsewhere

filename = 'example01'

# the UCI file generated by PyHSPF is named 'example01.uci' -- look at that 
# file to see how the information in this script is translated to HSPF.

# the input and output WDM filenames are generated automatically, and are the
# model filename + '_in.wdm' for the input WDM file and '_out.wdm' for the 
# output file (we'll need this later to retrieve results from the files)

wdmoutfile = filename + '_out.wdm'

# let's also generate an optional output file created by HSPF directly

outfile = filename + '.out' 

# create an instance of the HSPFModel class
messagepath = 'hspfmsg.wdm'

hspfmodel = HSPFModel( messagepath = messagepath)

# and build the model from the watershed

hspfmodel.build_from_watershed(watershed, filename, print_file = outfile, 
                               tstep = tstep)

# to run a simulation it is necessary to assign precipitation, potential 
# evapotranspiration, and any other time series to the subbasins.
# there are many different ways to estimate the potential evapotranspiration 
# including correlation to observed pan evaporation, Penman-Monteith, etc. 
# here the potential evapotranspiration is assumed to start at zero then 
# increase to 12 mm in a day 7/01, then decreases to zero 1/01; thus max 4-hr 
# potential evapotranspiration is 2 mm. the following statement will generate
# a time series with these assumptions.

maxET = 2
nsteps = (end-start).days * 1440 // tstep
evaporation = [maxET * (d - datetime.datetime(d.year, 1, 1)).days / 
               (datetime.datetime(d.year, 7, 1) - 
                datetime.datetime(d.year, 1, 1)).days
               if d.month < 7
               else
               maxET - maxET * (d - datetime.datetime(d.year, 7, 1)).days / 
               (datetime.datetime(d.year + 1, 1, 1) - 
                datetime.datetime(d.year, 7, 1)).days
               for d in [start + datetime.timedelta(minutes = tstep) * i
                         for i in range(nsteps)]
               ]

# specify the time series type

tstype = 'evaporation'

# give the dataset a unique identifier

identifier = 'example_evap'

# finally need the start date, a list of the data, and the time step (min)

hspfmodel.add_timeseries(tstype, identifier, start, evaporation, tstep = tstep)

# now tell HSPF how to use the time series for this model. the unique
# identifier for the time series and the unique subbasin numbers are used 
# to make this connection. we will assign this time series to the whole
# watershed, although you can have a unique time series for each subbasin, 
# landuse category, or each operation if you want.

hspfmodel.assign_watershed_timeseries(tstype, identifier)

# now add some random rainfall. here it is assumed there is a 5% chance of rain
# every 4-hour period and that the rainfall is an integer between 0 and 20.

import random

# make random numbers for each 4 hour timestep
# if the number is greater than 0.95 (5% chance), let's say it's raining and
# assign a value (this should give about a meter of rain per year)

rainfall = [random.randint(0,20) if random.random() > 0.95 else 0. 
            for i in range(nsteps)]

# assign the precipitation time series to the file

tstype     = 'precipitation'
identifier = 'example_prec'

hspfmodel.add_timeseries(tstype, identifier, start, rainfall, tstep = tstep)

# again connect the time series to all the subbasins in the watershed

hspfmodel.assign_watershed_timeseries(tstype, identifier)

# now add default parameters to the HSPF land segments and reaches to run a
# hydrology-only simulation--similar methods exist to add the parameters for
# other HSPF modules

hspfmodel.add_hydrology()

# and now build the wdm input file using the timeseries

hspfmodel.build_wdminfile()

# the last piece of info that must be specified is the output information from 
# the simulation, which is stored in an output WDM file (made automatically
# by PyHSPF). PyHSPF doesn't have every possible HSPF external target variable,
# but the list can be appended pretty easily if needed. the base assumption is 
# every time step for fluxes and daily for state variables.

targets = ['reach_outvolume',  # the volume that exits each reach at each step
           'evaporation',      # the evaporation volume in the land segments
           'reach_volume',     # the volume in the reach
           'runoff',           # the surface runoff
           ]

# the targets above each correspond to a particular Fortran variable; the idea
# is to make them more descriptive and easier to add. the targets above 
# correspond to:
#
# reach_outvolume = ROVOL
# evaporation     = TAET for PERLNDs, and IMPEV for IMPLNDs
# reach_volume    = RO
# runoff          = SURO, IFWO, and AGWO for PERLNDs, SURO for IMPLNDs

# now the "build_uci" function can be used to build the UCI input file.
# it also builds the output WDM file since it works together with the UCI 
# file. this example just does hydrology but flags exist to add air temperature,
# snow, sediment, etc to the simulation assuming the required information has
# been provided.

hspfmodel.build_uci(targets, start, end, hydrology = True, verbose = False)

# now the input files are ready, so run it

hspfmodel.run(verbose = True)

# now "pickle" the hspfmodel for later. "pickling" means writing a python
# object to a file so that it can be accessed later. the concept is to save
# the PyHSPF HSPFModel instance, and forget about the UCI. The UCI file is 
# always there if you want to see it, but changing the parameters is much 
# easier in Python, and can even be scripted. The "with" statement just closes 
# the file where the HSPFModel is stored.
