# Purpose: This example mimicks the example from the HSPF "Expert" system 
# (hspexp) for the Hunting Creek Watershed in the Patuxent River Basin. 
# This is a more "real" example of how to create an HSPF model using pyhspf. 
# Assumes the user has some familiarity with Python, hydrologic modeling, 
# and has done the first example.

# description of simulation

# this example uses a daily time step (pyhspf needs time step in minutes)

tstep = 60 * 24

# import the Watershed and Subbasin classes to use to build the model

from pyhspf import Watershed, Subbasin

# need to assign a name to the subbasin, which (unfortunately) has to be
# a string variable of length of at most 15
